# Welcome to Anti Golang Standards

This organization collects offending repos from GitHub that violate the [K.I.S.S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) principle for [Golang](https://golang.org/doc/faq#Why_doesnt_Go_have_feature_X).

If you have a project you think that qualifies this criteria, please take the following steps:
1. File an issue to this repo with the project details and why you think it should be added.
2. A public vote will take place with users voting for/against the idea with comments/reactions.
3. Unless there's a strong against sentiment/votes, the project will be incubated into the organization.

We're still refining the selection and qualification process as we go. If you have ideas or suggestions, please file an issue to this repo.

### A note on subjectiveness
What violates and what does not is a subjective decision. We as developers, have tried to accommodate as many repos to give them a fair chance of not being classified as offenders. But if working everyday with a project becomes a chore or introduces unnecessary time sink, that repo deserves a fair trial to be added in to this organization.
